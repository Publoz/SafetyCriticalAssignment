# SafetyCriticalAssignment

This assignment we had to write code for a safety critical system - a steam boiler.
It was very complex and the system had many parts that could go wrong in totally different ways. We had to account for all of them.

## What I learnt
- Writing code to handle all possible combinations of failure in a system
- Predicting a system's values when the sensors are damaged, in an effort to carry on
- Coming up with novel approaches to deal with and detect failures
- Writing test cases to find holes in my code (and the lecturer's code it would turn out)

This was my most challenging assignment by far, but after many hours, I was proud to obtain A+
